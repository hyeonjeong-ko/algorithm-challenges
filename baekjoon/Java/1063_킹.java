A solution to a chess piece movement simulation.

Metadata
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time Taken**: 45 mins
- **Answer Rate**: 42.240%

Analysis
**Input**:
- Three strings from user input: `K`, `S`, and `N`
  - `K`: Current position of the King on a chessboard (e.g., "A1")
  - `S`: Current position of a Stone on a chessboard (e.g., "B2")
  - `N`: Number of moves to process

**Expected Time Complexity**: O(N)

**Implementation**
- **Data Structures**: 
  - Dictionary (HashMap) for direction mappings
- **Algorithms**: 
  - Mapping character-based chess positions to integer indices

**Result**
- **Time Complexity**: O(N)

More
- **Key insights**: 
  - Convert chess board positions to numerical indices for easier manipulation. (ord(),chr())
